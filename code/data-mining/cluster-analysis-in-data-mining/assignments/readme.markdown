## Programming Assignment
### Goals
[1]. Implement the following clustering algorithms:

- K-means and
- Kernel K-means.

In doing so, you will become more familiar with the details of k-means algorithm and it's kernel variation.

[2]. In addition, you will also implement the following supervised clustering evaluation metrics: purity and NMI,
which will help you understand the performance of different clustering algorithms.
