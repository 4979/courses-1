## Build Intelligent Applications: Mastering machine learning
by [University of Washington](http://www.washington.edu/), USA.

### About This Specialization
Extract insights from data, build self-improving applications, and apply algorithms to real-world problems.

This Specialization provides a case-based introduction to the exciting, high-demand field of machine learning.
You’ll learn to analyze large and complex datasets, build applications that can make predictions from data, and create systems that adapt and improve over time. In the final Capstone Project, you’ll apply your skills to solve an original, real-world problem through implementation of machine learning algorithms.
